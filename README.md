Material of video PE #86: Modelling MOSFET Parasitic Capacitances

Available at: https://youtu.be/CLBtDAsLHSM

In this video we see how to model non-linear MOSFET parasitic capacitances using a simple irrational model typically found in the literature. Using this model, the charge and energy in the non-linear capacitor can be calculated by integration. The implementation of the model in Qspice is also shown.
